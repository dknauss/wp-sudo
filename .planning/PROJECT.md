# WP Sudo

## What This Is

WP Sudo is a WordPress plugin that provides action-gated reauthentication. Dangerous admin operations (plugin activation, user deletion, critical settings changes, etc.) require password confirmation before they proceed — regardless of user role. It covers 7 request surfaces (admin UI, REST API, AJAX, WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, WPGraphQL) with per-surface policy controls.

## Core Value

Every destructive WordPress admin action requires proof that the person at the keyboard is still the authenticated user — not a hijacked session, XSS payload, or unattended browser.

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [x] Playwright E2E test infrastructure covering PHPUnit-uncoverable scenarios — v2.14
- [x] WP 7.0 visual regression baselines — v2.14
- [x] Admin UI smoke tests in a real browser — v2.14
- [x] E2E tests in CI on every push — v2.14
- [x] Local multisite network-admin regression for symlinked plugin installs — v2.14.1

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Client-side modal challenge — design-heavy, separate milestone
- Session activity dashboard widget — feature work, not testing infrastructure
- Gutenberg block editor integration — depends on Playwright being in place first
- Network policy hierarchy — feature work, not testing infrastructure
- Per-session sudo isolation — architectural change, not testing
- REST API sudo grant endpoint — feature work

## Context

WP Sudo has comprehensive PHPUnit coverage (see `../docs/current-metrics.md` for current counts) plus real-browser coverage for the highest-risk flows PHPUnit cannot exercise fully. The original browser gap centered on five scenarios:

1. **Cookie attributes** — `setcookie()` output (httponly, SameSite, Secure) not capturable
2. **Admin bar countdown JS** — requires real DOM + `setInterval`
3. **MU-plugin install button AJAX** — button click -> AJAX -> file copy -> status update
4. **Block editor snackbar** (future) — requires `@wordpress/notices` API in browser
5. **Challenge page keyboard navigation** — real focus management needs browser DOM

Those five scenarios drove the Phase 6-8 Playwright work. The settings page, challenge flow, admin bar, and one Local-only multisite network-admin regression are now covered end to end in a real browser. WP 7.0 GA ships April 9, 2026 with an admin visual refresh, so keeping those baselines current remains useful for drift detection.

WordPress dev environment: PHP 8.1+, WP 6.7+. CI matrix: unit tests on PHP 8.1-8.4, integration tests on PHP 8.1/8.3, WP 6.7 and 7.0-beta4, single-site + multisite. Playwright hosted CI remains single-site via `wp-env`; Local `multisite-subdomains.local` now provides the dedicated multisite network-admin browser regression target.

Current multisite browser coverage is intentionally narrow: `MULTI-01` proves network-admin session reauthentication returns to the correct network URL on a real Local multisite install. The main remaining browser gap is not return URL handling, but network-admin stash/challenge/replay for gated actions that only exist on multisite.

Recommended next multisite browser sequence:

1. `MULTI-02` — `network/themes.php` network enable/disable GET stash replay
2. `MULTI-03` — `sites.php` confirm/action2 flow for archive/deactivate/spam/delete
3. `MULTI-04` — network settings POST replay

## Constraints

- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing CI matrix (GitHub Actions, Ubuntu)
- **WordPress test env**: Needs a running WordPress instance with WP Sudo activated (wp-env or similar)
- **No build step pollution**: Playwright deps must not affect the plugin's zero-production-dependency stance
- **CI time budget**: E2E suite should add no more than ~2 minutes to CI pipeline
- **Local multisite drift**: Symlinked Local/Studio plugin installs can execute the plugin from the repo target path, not the public `wp-content/plugins/<slug>` path. Bootstrap URL logic must recover the public plugin basename from active plugin state, and browser regressions for that behavior remain local-only.
- **Multisite browser scope**: Hosted Playwright CI still cannot prove network-admin-only stash/replay behavior. Local multisite regressions should target multisite-specific routing seams in priority order instead of adding broad duplicate coverage.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Playwright over Cypress | Playwright has better multi-browser support, faster execution, and native WordPress ecosystem adoption (Gutenberg uses it) | Adopted — @playwright/test 1.58.2, Chromium only |
| wp-env for test environment | Standard WordPress dev tool, used by Gutenberg, handles DB setup | Adopted — @wordpress/env 11.1.0, port 8889 |
| Visual regression via screenshot comparison | Catches WP 7.0 admin refresh breakage without manual testing | Adopted — 4 baselines captured (challenge card, settings form, admin bar active/expiring) |
| Local multisite browser verification stays outside hosted CI | GitHub-hosted `wp-env` is single-site; the multisite network-admin failure only surfaced on a symlinked Local install | Adopted — keep hosted CI single-site, add Local multisite regression + helper script + bootstrap hardening |

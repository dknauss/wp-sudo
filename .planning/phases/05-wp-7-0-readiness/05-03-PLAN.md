<objective>
Bump the "Tested up to" version in readme.txt from 6.9 to 7.0 after WordPress 7.0 GA ships on April 9, 2026.

Purpose: WP70-03 requires the version declaration be updated. This is a one-line edit in readme.txt line 8. The plugin header in wp-sudo.php does NOT have a "Tested up to" field — only readme.txt needs this change.
Output: Updated `readme.txt` with `Tested up to: 7.0`

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Bump "Tested up to" version in readme.txt</name>
  <files>readme.txt</files>
  <action>
**TIME GATE: Do NOT execute this task before April 9, 2026 (WP 7.0 GA).**

Edit `readme.txt` line 8. Change:
```
Tested up to:      6.9
```
to:
```
Tested up to:      7.0
```

This is the ONLY file that needs this change. Per research finding #1, `wp-sudo.php` has no "Tested up to" field in the plugin header. Do NOT modify wp-sudo.php.

Preserve the exact whitespace formatting (6 spaces between colon and version number).
  </action>
  <verify>
`grep "Tested up to:" readme.txt` returns `Tested up to:      7.0`
`grep "Tested up to:" wp-sudo.php` returns no match (confirming plugin header has no such field).
  </verify>
  <done>readme.txt line 8 reads "Tested up to:      7.0" and no other files were modified for this version bump.</done>
</task>

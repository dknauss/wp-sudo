<objective>
User executes the full MANUAL-TESTING.md guide against WP 7.0 beta/RC, including the new section 15 (WP 7.0 Visual Compatibility). This satisfies WP70-01 and WP70-02.

Purpose: Verify the plugin works correctly under WP 7.0 with zero regressions. The automated test suite already runs against WP 7.0 trunk in CI — this covers the visual and interactive behaviors that require a real browser.
Output: MANUAL-TESTING.md with recorded test results in section 15

  <name>Task 1: Execute manual testing guide against WP 7.0</name>
  <action>
The user must run the full MANUAL-TESTING.md guide (all 15 sections) against a WP 7.0 beta/RC environment. Focus especially on the new section 15 (WP 7.0 Visual Compatibility).

**Test environments:**
- Studio at localhost:8883 (WP 7.0-alpha-61682) — best for admin UI visual checks
- Local at localhost:10045 (WP 7.0-alpha-61682) — best for CLI, cron, app-password, multisite tests

**What to do:**
1. Open `tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md` in an editor.
2. Work through sections 1-14 against your WP 7.0 environment, noting any regressions.
3. Work through section 15 (WP 7.0 Visual Compatibility), filling in PASS/FAIL and date for each subsection.
4. If any visual regressions are found in section 15, document them clearly (screenshot URLs, CSS property mismatches, etc.).
5. Report back with: (a) number of sections passing, (b) any failures or regressions, (c) section 15 results.

**Why this requires human action:** Browser-based visual testing and interactive UI flows cannot be automated by Claude. The plugin's challenge page, admin bar countdown, and gated action flows require real browser interaction.
  </action>
  <resume-signal>Report results: "all pass" or describe any failures/regressions found. If section 15 results are filled in the file, say "results recorded."</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Record test results in MANUAL-TESTING.md</name>
  <files>tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md</files>
  <action>
Based on the user's reported test results from Task 1, update section 15 of `tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md`:
- Fill in `[PASS/FAIL - date tested]` for each of the 5 subsections (15.1 through 15.5).
- If the user already filled in results directly, verify they are recorded and commit the file.
- If the user reports any regressions, add a note under the affected subsection with the details.

Skip this task if the user has already edited the file directly and the results are recorded.
  </action>
  <verify>
`grep -c "PASS\|FAIL" tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md` shows results recorded in section 15.
  </verify>
  <done>Section 15 of MANUAL-TESTING.md has test results recorded for all 5 WP 7.0 visual compatibility checks.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Section 15 has PASS/FAIL results for all 5 subsections
- No regressions reported in sections 1-14
- WP70-01 satisfied: manual testing guide executed against WP 7.0 beta/RC
- WP70-02 satisfied: settings page, challenge page, admin bar verified under admin visual refresh
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 15 sections of MANUAL-TESTING.md pass on WP 7.0 with zero regressions
- Section 15 results are recorded in the file
- Any visual regressions are documented with details
</success_criteria>

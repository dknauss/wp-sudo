# WP Sudo

WP Sudo adds **action-gated reauthentication** to WordPress so high-risk operations require fresh confirmation before they proceed.

> **Status:** exploratory plugin, not yet production-ready. See [docs/release-status.md](docs/release-status.md) for current stable-vs-`main` status and [tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md](tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md) if you want to help evaluate it.

## Why WP Sudo exists

WordPress has roles, capabilities, and authentication, but it has no native way to say:

> this action is consequential enough that a valid session alone should not be enough.

WP Sudo adds that missing layer on the covered paths it intercepts.

It is designed to reduce risk when an attacker has:
- a stolen browser session cookie,
- access to an unattended authenticated browser,
- or a delegated request path that reaches a high-impact operation.

On those covered paths, a valid session without an active sudo window is not enough.

## What WP Sudo covers

WP Sudo currently gates built-in operations across categories such as:
- plugin and theme management,
- user creation, deletion, and role changes,
- file editor access,
- critical option changes,
- WordPress core updates,
- export flows,
- WP Sudo settings themselves,
- selected Multisite network actions,
- and connector credential writes saved through the REST settings endpoint.

For the canonical current rule totals and surface counts, see [docs/current-metrics.md](docs/current-metrics.md).

## How it works

### Browser requests
For wp-admin flows, WP Sudo redirects the user to a challenge screen. After successful reauthentication, the original request can continue.

### AJAX and REST requests
These receive a `sudo_required` error instead of silently proceeding.

### Non-interactive surfaces
WP Sudo supports configurable policies for:
- WP-CLI
- Cron
- XML-RPC
- REST Application Passwords
- WPGraphQL (when active)

Each surface can be set to **Disabled**, **Limited**, or **Unrestricted**.

## What WP Sudo does **not** do

WP Sudo is deliberately narrow. It is **not**:
- a replacement for WordPress capabilities,
- a firewall or exploit detector,
- a fix for arbitrary broken access control inside third-party plugin code,
- or a sandbox for malicious in-process code.

It is strongest when an attacker has a valid session but **does not** have an active sudo window and must cross one of the plugin's covered action paths.

Active sudo is **per browser session**, not site-wide.

## Requirements

- **WordPress:** 6.2+
- **PHP:** 8.0+
- **Multisite:** supported

For current release posture, supported lanes, and forward `main` notes, see [docs/release-status.md](docs/release-status.md).

## Quick start

1. Install and activate WP Sudo.
2. Go to **Settings → Sudo**.
3. Choose a session duration.
4. Review the default policies for non-interactive surfaces.
5. Optionally install the bundled mu-plugin loader from the settings page for earlier hook registration.
6. Test a covered action such as plugin activation or a protected settings change.

### Recommended companion plugins

- [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) — strongly recommended for password + second-factor challenge flows.
- [WP Activity Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-audit-log/) or [Stream](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/) — recommended if you want audit visibility from WP Sudo's action hooks.

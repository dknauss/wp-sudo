# Changelog

## 2.9.2

- **Fix: 2FA help text corrected** — `includes/class-admin.php` displayed "The default 2FA window is 10 minutes" but the code default (set in v2.4.0) is `5 * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS`. Help text now reads "5 minutes". The sudo session countdown (admin bar) is a separate, unrelated timer that remains at 15 minutes.
- **Fix: version constant drift in dev bootstrap files** — `phpstan-bootstrap.php` and `tests/bootstrap.php` both defined `WP_SUDO_VERSION = '2.8.0'` while the runtime plugin was at v2.9.1. Both bumped to `'2.9.2'`.
- **Docs: readme.txt expanded** — Patchstack 2026 attack statistics (57% BAC, 80% sudo-mitigated, 5 h median exploit time) added to the Description section. Eight new FAQ entries added: what problem Sudo solves, how it differs from security plugins, limitations, brute-force protection, login session grant, password change behaviour, grace period, and the 2FA verification window. Integration and unit test counts corrected.
- **397 unit tests, 944 assertions.**

## 2.9.1

- **Docs: threat model kill chain** — `docs/security-model.md` gains a new "Threat Model: The Kill Chain" section with verified statistics from Patchstack (2024 vulnerability breakdown), Sucuri (post-compromise forensics), Verizon DBIR (credential attacks), Wordfence (55B password attacks blocked), and OWASP Top 10:2025 (Broken Access Control #1). Risk reduction estimates table included. `FAQ.md` adds a condensed "Why this matters by the numbers" paragraph. All statistics verified 2026-02-27 against primary sources.
- **Docs: project size table** — `readme.md` gains a "Project Size" subsection (6,688 production lines, 11,555 test lines, 1.7:1 ratio). `CLAUDE.md` gains verification commands and a pre-release checklist note to keep the table current. Stale test counts in `readme.md` corrected (375/905 → 397/944, 73 → 92 integration). Missing v2.8.0 and v2.9.0 changelog entries added to `readme.md`.
- **397 unit tests, 944 assertions.**

## 2.9.0

- **Feature: `wp_sudo_action_allowed` audit hook** — fires when a gated action is permitted by an Unrestricted policy. Covers all five non-interactive surfaces: REST App Passwords (`$user_id, $rule_id, 'rest_app_password'`), WP-CLI (`0, $rule_id, 'cli'`), Cron (`0, $rule_id, 'cron'`), XML-RPC (`0, $rule_id, 'xmlrpc'`), and WPGraphQL (`$user_id, 'wpgraphql', 'wpgraphql'` — mutations only). WPGraphQL queries do not fire the hook. Implemented by adding an `'audit'` mode to `register_function_hooks()` for CLI/Cron/XML-RPC, and inline `do_action()` calls for REST and WPGraphQL. This is the ninth audit hook.
- **Docs: CLAUDE.md accuracy audit** — corrected six inaccuracies: policy names, missing doc reference, missing password-change hooks in bootstrap sequence, rule count ambiguity, and hook count. Logged one confabulation (fabricated `wp_sudo_action_allowed` documentation in `ai-agentic-guidance.md`) in `llm_lies_log.txt`.
- **Docs: manual testing** — MANUAL-TESTING.md adds §19 (Unrestricted audit hook verification for all five surfaces) with forward references from existing Unrestricted subsections.
- **397 unit tests, 944 assertions.**

## 2.8.0

- **Feature: expire sudo session on password change** — hooks `after_password_reset` (lost-password flow) and `profile_update` (admin profile, user-edit, REST API) to invalidate any active sudo session when a user's password changes. Handlers guard with a meta-existence check before calling `deactivate()` to avoid phantom `wp_sudo_deactivated` audit events for users without sessions. Closes the gap where a compromised session persisted after a password reset.
- **Feature: WPGraphQL conditional display** — the WPGraphQL policy dropdown on Settings > Sudo, the WPGraphQL paragraph in the "Session & Policies" help tab, and the Site Health policy review all adapt based on whether WPGraphQL is installed. When inactive: the dropdown is hidden, the help tab shows an install note instead of the full explanation, and Site Health does not flag the WPGraphQL policy.
- **Docs: WPGraphQL surface-level gating rationale** — `docs/developer-reference.md` Rule Structure section now explains why WPGraphQL is gated at the surface level rather than per-action, with a forward reference to the WPGraphQL Surface section.
- **Docs: manual testing additions** — MANUAL-TESTING.md adds §16.0 (WPGraphQL conditional behavior when plugin inactive) and §18 (password change expires sudo session — three scenarios).
- **391 unit tests, 929 assertions.**

## 2.7.0

- **Feature: `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass` filter** — fires in Limited mode before mutation detection. Return `true` to allow a request through without sudo session checks. Solves compatibility with [wp-graphql-jwt-authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication): the JWT `login` mutation is sent by unauthenticated users and was blocked by the default Limited policy, breaking the entire JWT authentication flow. A documented bridge mu-plugin exempts `login` and `refreshJwtAuthToken` mutations while keeping all other mutations gated. The filter does not fire in Disabled or Unrestricted mode.
- **Fix: WPGraphQL now listed in non-interactive entry points** — the "How Sudo Works" help tab text omitted WPGraphQL from the list of non-interactive surfaces.
- **379 unit tests, 915 assertions.**

## 2.6.1

- **Fix: WPGraphQL integration tests now call `check_wpgraphql()` directly** — `Gate::check_wpgraphql( string $body ): ?WP_Error` extracted from `gate_wpgraphql()` so integration tests can exercise the policy logic without WPGraphQL installed or `wp_send_json()`/`exit` side effects. No behavioral change in production. Fixes a pre-existing CI regression introduced in v2.5.1 when WPGraphQL gating moved from `rest_request_before_callbacks` to `graphql_process_http_request`.
- **Docs: full documentation update for v2.6.0** — FAQ, ROADMAP, readme.txt, readme.md, developer-reference.md, security-model.md, MANUAL-TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md updated to reflect all v2.6.0 features (login grant, password-change gating, grace period).
- **375 unit tests, 905 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.6.0

- **Feature: login implicitly grants a sudo session** — a successful WordPress browser-based login (via `wp_login`) now automatically activates a sudo session. The user just proved their identity via the login form; requiring a second challenge immediately is unnecessary friction. This mirrors the behaviour of Unix `sudo` and GitHub's sudo mode. Application Password and XML-RPC logins are unaffected (`wp_login` does not fire for those). Implemented in `Plugin::grant_session_on_login()`.
- **Feature: `user.change_password` gated action** — changing a user's password on `profile.php` or `user-edit.php` now requires an active sudo session. The rule fires only when `pass1` or `pass2` is present in the POST body, narrowing it to actual password changes (not bio, email, or role updates, which also use `action=update`). The REST counterpart gates any `PUT`/`PATCH` to `/wp/v2/users/{id}` or `/wp/v2/users/me` that includes a `password` parameter. Closes the "session theft → silent password change → lockout" attack chain.
- **Feature: grace period (two-tier expiry)** — sudo sessions now have a 120-second grace window (`GRACE_SECONDS = 120`) after they expire. If a user was filling in a form while the session expired, the form submission still passes the gate without requiring re-authentication. The grace window is session-token-verified — a stolen cookie in a different browser does not gain grace access. Session meta cleanup is deferred until the grace window closes so the token is available for verification throughout. The four admin-bar UI call sites are intentionally excluded (the timer always reflects the true session state).
- **375 unit tests, 905 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.5.2

- **Fix: WPGraphQL Limited policy now blocks unauthenticated mutations** — cross-origin requests (e.g. from a SvelteKit frontend) do not carry WordPress session cookies, so `get_current_user_id()` returns 0. Previously the Limited policy silently passed these through via an `if (!$user_id) return` guard before the session check was reached. Now, unauthenticated mutations are blocked with the same `sudo_blocked` 403 response as authenticated-without-session mutations. The `$user_id &&` short-circuit prevents `Sudo_Session::is_active()` from ever being called with user 0.
- **Fix: per-application-password policy dropdown now renders on profile pages** — two bugs prevented the dropdown column from appearing: (1) the JS looked for `.application-passwords-list-table` which does not exist; the table lives inside `.application-passwords-list-table-wrapper`. (2) UUID extraction tried to read `data-slug` from the revoke button, which carries no data attributes; WordPress already sets `data-uuid` directly on each `<tr>`. Both are now corrected.
- **Fix: `user.promote` rule now fires on bulk role changes** — the Action Registry `user.promote` rule declared `'method' => 'GET'`, but WordPress's bulk role change action on `users.php` POSTs the request. Changing the method to `ANY` ensures both the single-user edit and bulk promote paths are gated.
- **Security: sudo session required for MU-plugin install/uninstall** — `handle_mu_install()` and `handle_mu_uninstall()` only checked capability; now they also require an active sudo session (returns `sudo_required` 403 if absent).
- **Security: sudo session required for per-app-password policy save** — `handle_app_password_policy_save()` only checked capability; now also requires an active sudo session.
- **UX: per-app-password dropdown surfaces `sudo_required` response** — when the policy save AJAX returns `sudo_required`, the dropdown restores its previous value, shows an amber outline, and displays an alert explaining that a sudo session is needed.
- **Docs: WPGraphQL persisted queries caveat** — corrected the absolute claim in `security-model.md` that the mutation heuristic "cannot false-negative on an actual GraphQL mutation"; it cannot detect mutations sent via the Persisted Queries extension. Added explicit guidance to use the Disabled policy in persisted-query environments.
- **Docs: WPGraphQL headless authentication boundary** — added a new subsection to `security-model.md` explaining why Limited behaves identically to Disabled for most cross-origin headless deployments, with per-deployment policy recommendations. Cross-referenced from a new `## WPGraphQL Surface` section in `docs/developer-reference.md`.
- **361 unit tests, 882 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.5.1

- **Fix: WPGraphQL gating now functional** — v2.5.0 hooked into `rest_request_before_callbacks`, but WPGraphQL dispatches requests via WordPress rewrite rules at `parse_request`, not through the REST API pipeline. The REST filter never fired for GraphQL requests. The fix hooks into WPGraphQL's own `graphql_process_http_request` action, which fires after authentication but before body reading, regardless of how the endpoint is named or configured. No endpoint URL matching is needed.
- **Remove `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_route` filter** — the filter was designed for the now-dead URL-matching approach and has no effect. Removed from the codebase and all documentation.
- **361 unit tests, 881 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.5.0

- **WPGraphQL surface gating** — adds WPGraphQL as a fifth non-interactive surface alongside WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, and Application Passwords. Three-tier policy (Disabled / Limited / Unrestricted); default is Limited. In Limited mode, GraphQL mutations are blocked without an active sudo session while read-only queries pass through. Fires the `wp_sudo_action_blocked` audit hook on block. The policy setting (`wpgraphql_policy`) is stored regardless of whether WPGraphQL is installed; the settings field is only shown when WPGraphQL is active.
- **Mutation detection heuristic** — Limited mode checks whether the POST body contains the word `mutation`. Intentionally blunt: cannot false-negative on actual mutations, may false-positive on queries mentioning "mutation" in a string argument. Documented in `docs/security-model.md`.
- **`wp_sudo_wpgraphql_route` filter** — allows the gated route to be overridden to match custom WPGraphQL endpoint configurations.
- **Site Health integration** — WPGraphQL policy included in the Entry Point Policies health check (flagged if set to Unrestricted).
- **364 unit tests, 887 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.4.2

- **Documentation: roadmap consolidation** — Merged three separate roadmaps (`ROADMAP.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY-ROADMAP.md`, `docs/roadmap-2026-02.md`) into one unified `ROADMAP.md` at project root. Moved `CHANGELOG.md` and `FAQ.md` to root for prominence.
- **Planned Development Timeline** — Added comprehensive timeline at the top of ROADMAP.md showing immediate, short-term, medium-term, and deferred work phases. Provides quick reference for what will actually be implemented.
- **Table of Contents** — Added scannable TOC to ROADMAP.md linking to all 10 sections plus appendix.

## 2.4.1

- **AJAX gating integration tests** — 11 new tests covering the AJAX surface: rule matching for all 7 declared AJAX actions, full intercept flow via `wp_doing_ajax` filter, session bypass, non-gated pass-through, blocked transient lifecycle, admin notice fallback (`render_blocked_notice`), and `wp.updates` slug passthrough.
- **Action registry filter integration tests** — 3 new tests verifying custom rules added via `wp_sudo_gated_actions` are matched by the Gate in a real WordPress environment; including custom admin rules, custom AJAX rules, and filter-based removal of built-in rules.
- **Audit hook coverage** — `wp_sudo_action_blocked` now integration-tested for CLI, Cron, and XML-RPC surfaces (in addition to REST app-password). Documents that `wp_sudo_action_allowed` is intentionally absent from the production code path.
- **CI quality gate** — new GitHub Actions job runs PHPCS and PHPStan on every push and PR; Composer dependency cache added to unit and integration jobs; nightly scheduled run at 3 AM UTC catches WordPress trunk regressions.
- **MU-plugin manual install instructions** — fallback copy instructions added to the settings page UI (`<details>` disclosure) and help tab for environments where the one-click installer fails due to file permissions.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — new contributor guide covering prerequisites, local setup, unit vs integration test distinction, TDD workflow, and lint/analyse requirements.
- **349 unit tests, 863 assertions. 73 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.4.0

- **Integration test suite** — 55 integration tests running against a real WordPress + MySQL environment via `WP_UnitTestCase`. Covers sudo session lifecycle (bcrypt verification, token binding, rate limiting, expiry), request stash/replay with transient TTL, full reauth flow (5-class end-to-end), REST API gating with cookie auth and application passwords, upgrader migration chain, audit hook arguments, Two Factor plugin interaction, and multisite session isolation.
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow with unit tests across PHP 8.1–8.4 and integration tests against WordPress `latest` and `trunk` (including multisite variant). MySQL 8.0 service container with health checks.
- **Fix: multisite site-management gate gap** — Archive, Spam, Delete, and Deactivate site actions on Network Admin → Sites now correctly trigger the sudo challenge. WordPress core's `sites.php` sends `action=confirm` with the real action in `action2`; the Gate now checks both parameters.
- **Fix: admin bar timer width** — the countdown timer's red (expiring) state no longer stretches wider than the green (active) state. Defensive CSS constrains the background to content width regardless of WP core layout context.
- **Fix: WP 7.0 admin notice background** — restored white background on WP Sudo admin notices, which lost their background color in WP 7.0's admin visual refresh.
- **Fix: 2FA countdown advisory-only** — the two-factor verification window is now advisory (5 minutes, reduced from 10). Expired 2FA codes are still accepted if the underlying provider validates them, preventing false rejections for slow email delivery.
- **Fix: `setcookie()` headers-already-sent guard** — `Sudo_Session::activate()` now checks `headers_sent()` before calling `setcookie()`, preventing warnings in CLI and integration test contexts.
- **Verification requirements** — CLAUDE.md now mandates live source verification for all external code references, with documented verification commands. LLM lies log tracks 5 prior fabrications that were corrected.
- **WP 7.0 Beta 1 tested** — manual testing guide completed against WP 7.0 Beta 1 (15 sections, all PASS). Visual compatibility, help tabs, challenge page, and admin bar verified against the refreshed admin chrome.
- **349 unit tests, 863 assertions. 55 integration tests in CI.**

## 2.3.2

- **Fix: admin bar sr-only text leak** — screen-reader-only milestone text no longer renders in the dashboard canvas. The admin bar `<li>` node now establishes a containing block (`position: relative`) and sr-only elements use `clip-path: inset(50%)` alongside the legacy `clip` property.
- **Documentation overhaul** — readmes slimmed to storefront length. Full content extracted to `docs/`: [security model](security-model.md), [developer reference](developer-reference.md), [FAQ](FAQ.md), and this changelog. [Manual testing guide](../tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md) rewritten for v2.3.1+ with per-app-password testing, MU-plugin toggle, and iframe edge case coverage.
- **Composer lock compatibility** — `config.platform.php` set to `8.1.99` so the lock file resolves packages compatible with PHP 8.1+ regardless of the local PHP version. Fixes Copilot coding agent CI failure (`doctrine/instantiator` 2.1.0 requiring PHP 8.4+).
- **Housekeeping** — removed stale `WP-SUDO-PROJECT-STATE.md`; added `@since 2.0.0` to Upgrader class; updated CLAUDE.md and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with docs/ file listings.
- **343 unit tests, 853 assertions.**

## 2.3.1

- **Fix: Unicode escape rendering** — localized JS strings using bare `\uXXXX` escapes (not valid PHP Unicode syntax) now use actual UTF-8 characters, fixing visible backslash-escape text during challenge replay.
- **Fix: screen-reader-only text flash** — the sr-only "Verifying..." span no longer flashes visible fragments inside the flex container during challenge replay.
- **CycloneDX SBOM** — `bom.json` shipped in the repo for supply chain transparency. Regenerate with `composer sbom`.
- **Help tabs** — per-application-password policy section added to the Settings help tab. Help tab count corrected from 4 to 8 across readmes.
- **Copilot coding agent** — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `copilot-setup-steps.yml` added for GitHub Copilot integration.
- **Accessibility roadmap complete** — all items (critical through low priority) verified resolved and documented.
- **343 unit tests, 853 assertions.**

## 2.3.0

- **Per-application-password sudo policies** — individual Application Password credentials can now have their own Disabled, Limited, or Unrestricted policy override, independent of the global REST API (App Passwords) policy. Configure per-password policies from the Application Passwords section on the user profile page.
- **Challenge page iframe fix** — the reauthentication challenge page now breaks out of WordPress's `wp_iframe()` context, fixing a nested-frame display issue during plugin and theme updates.
- **Accessibility improvements** — admin bar countdown timer cleans up on page unload; lockout countdown screen reader announcements throttled to 30-second intervals; settings fields display default values.
- **PHPStan level 6 static analysis** — full codebase passes PHPStan level 6 with zero errors.
- **Documentation** — new [AI and agentic tool guidance](ai-agentic-guidance.md) and [UI/UX testing prompts](ui-ux-testing-prompts.md).
- **343 unit tests, 853 assertions.**

## 2.2.1

- **Security hardening** — stashed redirect URLs are now validated with `wp_validate_redirect()` before replay.
- **Accessibility** — ARIA `role="alert"` and `role="status"` added to gate notices; disabled-action text color improved to 4.6:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA).
- **2FA ecosystem documentation** — new [integration guide](two-factor-integration.md) and [ecosystem survey](two-factor-ecosystem.md) covering 7 major 2FA plugins with bridge patterns.
- **WP 2FA bridge** — drop-in bridge for WP 2FA by Melapress supporting TOTP, email OTP, and backup codes ([`bridges/wp-sudo-wp2fa-bridge.php`](../bridges/wp-sudo-wp2fa-bridge.php)).
- **Help tabs** — Settings tab moved to 2nd position; all four 2FA hooks documented; Security Model heading added.
- **334 unit tests, 792 assertions.**

## 2.2.0

- **Three-tier entry point policies** — replaces the binary Block/Allow toggle with three modes per surface: Disabled (shuts off the protocol entirely), Limited (default — gated actions blocked, non-gated work proceeds normally), and Unrestricted (everything passes through).
- **Function-level gating for non-interactive surfaces** — WP-CLI, Cron, and XML-RPC now hook into WordPress function-level actions (`activate_plugin`, `delete_plugin`, `set_user_role`, etc.) instead of matching request parameters. This makes gating reliable regardless of how the operation is triggered.
- **CLI enforces Cron policy** — `wp cron` subcommands respect the Cron policy even when CLI is Limited or Unrestricted. If Cron is Disabled, `wp cron event run` is blocked.
- **REST API policy split** — Disabled returns `sudo_disabled` (surface is off), Limited returns `sudo_blocked` (gated action denied), clearly distinguishing the two rejection reasons.
- **Automatic upgrade migration** — existing `block` settings migrate to `limited`, `allow` to `unrestricted`. Multisite-aware.
- **Site Health updated** — Disabled is treated as valid hardening (Good status). Unrestricted triggers a Recommended notice.
- **Manual testing guide** — comprehensive step-by-step verification procedures in `tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md`.
- **327 unit tests, 752 assertions.**

## 2.1.0

- Removes the `unfiltered_html` capability from the Editor role. Editors can no longer embed scripts, iframes, or other non-whitelisted HTML — KSES sanitization is always active for editors. Administrators retain `unfiltered_html`. The capability is restored if the plugin is deactivated or uninstalled.
- Adds tamper detection: if `unfiltered_html` reappears on the Editor role (e.g. via database modification), it is stripped automatically and the `wp_sudo_capability_tampered` action fires for audit logging.
- Fixes admin bar deactivation redirect: clicking the countdown timer to end a session now keeps you on the current page instead of redirecting to the dashboard.
- Replaces WordPress core's confusing "user editing capabilities" error with a clearer message when a bulk role change skips the current user.

## 2.0.0

Complete rewrite. Action-gated reauthentication replaces role-based privilege escalation.

- **New model** — gates dangerous operations behind reauthentication for any user, regardless of role. No custom role, no capability escalation.
- **Full attack surface coverage** — admin UI (stash-challenge-replay), AJAX (error + admin notice + session activation), REST API (cookie-auth challenge, app-password policy), WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC.
- **Action Registry** — 20 gated rules across 7 categories (plugins, themes, users, editors, options, updates, tools), plus 8 multisite-specific rules. Extensible via `wp_sudo_gated_actions` filter.
- **Entry point policies** — three-tier Disabled/Limited/Unrestricted policies for REST Application Passwords, WP-CLI, Cron, and XML-RPC.
- **2FA browser binding** — challenge cookie prevents cross-browser 2FA replay.
- **2FA countdown timer** — visible countdown during the verification step; configurable window via `wp_sudo_two_factor_window` filter.
- **Self-protection** — WP Sudo settings changes are gated.
- **MU-plugin toggle** — one-click install/uninstall from the settings page. Stable shim + loader pattern keeps the mu-plugin up to date with regular plugin updates.
- **Multisite** — network-wide settings, network-wide sessions, 8 network admin rules, `get_site_option`/`set_site_transient` storage.
- **8 audit hooks** — full lifecycle and policy logging for integration with WP Activity Log, Stream, and similar plugins.
- **Contextual help** — 8 help tabs on the settings page.
- **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA throughout (ARIA labels, focus management, status announcements, keyboard support).
- **281 unit tests, 686 assertions.**

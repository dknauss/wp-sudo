# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is Sudo different from other WordPress security plugins?

Any authenticated WordPress session is an attack surface. A stolen session cookie lets an attacker take over your session from another browser without knowing your password. An unattended machine with an active admin session leaves gated operations open to anyone with physical access. Open APIs allow authenticated and unauthenticated remote users and automated systems to probe them, connect, and potentially take damaging actions.

Conventional security plugins attempt to compensate for the limitations of mass-market hosting. Often they add layers of protection at the application level — rate-limiting and firewalling aimed at deterring malicious requests across some (usually undefined) portion of the exposed application surface. This can be resource-intensive work that is better handled at the server, network, or infrastructure layer. Post-breach malware scanning — the signature and purely performative feature of the worst security plugins — is detection after the fact — not defense. There's now years of evidence showing how malware targets and defeats these scanners after a breach. 

Sudo operates at the opposite end: not at the perimeter, but at the point of consequence. It gates every entry surface — admin UI, AJAX, REST API, WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, and WPGraphQL — with configurable policies, and within those surfaces gates the specific destructive actions that matter: plugin installation, user creation, role changes, settings modifications, theme switching, and core updates. The shape and extent of your site's attack surface becomes a deliberate policy decision. Close a surface entirely, limit it to non-destructive operations, or leave it open — per surface, per application password, per action.

This is your site's innermost armor — the skin-tight layer that interposes reauthentication at the moment of consequence, after every other defense has had its turn. There is no comparable WordPress plugin. This is not access control — it is action control.

**Why this matters by the numbers.** Of the 7,966 WordPress vulnerabilities catalogued in 2024 ([Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/state-of-wordpress-security-in-2025/)), ~28% fall into classes Sudo directly mitigates (Broken Access Control, CSRF, Privilege Escalation, Broken Authentication). When XSS exploitation chains are included — XSS is 47.7% of all WP vulnerabilities and is primarily dangerous because it enables session hijacking → admin actions — the figure rises to 55–65%. Post-compromise, [Sucuri found](https://sucuri.net/reports/2023-hacked-website-report/) that 55% of hacked WordPress databases contained malicious admin users and 49–70% had backdoor plugins — both actions that Sudo gates. In 2025 the total rose 42% to 11,334 ([Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/state-of-wordpress-security-in-2026/)), with highly exploitable vulnerabilities up 113% and traditional WAFs blocking only 12–26% of WordPress-specific attacks. See the [Security Model](docs/security-model.md#threat-model-the-kill-chain) for the full threat model and risk reduction estimates.

## What are Sudo's limitations?

WP Sudo does not protect against an attacker who already knows your WordPress password and one-time password (OTP) if two-factor authentication (2FA) is active. (Using two-factor is highly recommended on any site.) Someone who possesses all your credentials can, of course, complete the sudo challenge just as you can. Sudo also does not protect against direct database access or file system operations that bypass WordPress hooks. See the [Security Model](docs/security-model.md) for a full account of what WP Sudo does and does not defend against.

Also, there is no substitute for a first-class, security-hardened server and application environment. Learn what this means so you can deploy secure sites yourself or simply become a savvier hosting consumer:

## How does sudo gating work?

When a user attempts a gated action — for example, activating a plugin — Sudo intercepts the request at `admin_init`, before WordPress processes it. The original request is stashed in a transient, the user is redirected to a challenge page, and after successful reauthentication, the original request is replayed. For AJAX and REST requests, the browser receives a `sudo_required` error, and an admin notice appears on the next page load linking to the challenge page. The user authenticates, activates a sudo session, and retries the action.

## Does this replace WordPress roles and capabilities?

No. Sudo adds a reauthentication layer on top of the existing permission model. WordPress capability checks still run after the gate. A user who does not have the `activate_plugins` capability will still be denied after reauthenticating — Sudo does not grant any new permissions.

## Which operations are gated?

| Category | Operations |
|---|---|
| **Plugins** | Activate, deactivate, delete, install, update |
| **Themes** | Switch, delete, install, update |
| **Users** | Delete, change role, change password, create new user, create application password |
| **File editors** | Plugin editor, theme editor |
| **Critical options** | `siteurl`, `home`, `admin_email`, `default_role`, `users_can_register` |
| **WordPress core** | Update, reinstall |
| **Site data export** | WXR export |
| **WP Sudo settings** | Self-protected — settings changes require reauthentication |
| **Multisite** | Network theme enable/disable, site delete/deactivate/archive/spam, super admin grant/revoke, network settings |

Sudo's settings page includes a read-only Gated Actions table showing all registered rules and their covered surfaces: Admin, AJAX, WP-CLI, Cron, REST, XML-RPC, and GraphQL, if it's installed and active. 

Note: the surfaces shown reflect WordPress's actual API coverage — not all operations have REST endpoints. However, all gated actions are protected on non-interactive entry points (WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, Application Passwords) via the configurable policy settings. Developers can add custom rules via the `wp_sudo_gated_actions` filter.

## What about REST API and Application Passwords?

Cookie-authenticated REST requests (from the block editor, admin AJAX) receive a `sudo_required` error. An admin notice on the next page load links to the challenge page where the user can authenticate and activate a sudo session, then retry the action. Application Password and bearer-token REST requests are governed by a separate policy setting with three modes: **Disabled** (returns `sudo_disabled`), **Limited** (default — returns `sudo_blocked`), and **Unrestricted** (passes through with no checks). Individual application passwords can override the global policy from the user profile page — for example, a deployment pipeline password can be **Unrestricted** while an AI assistant password stays **Limited**.

## What about WP-CLI, Cron, and XML-RPC?

Each has its own three-tier policy setting: **Disabled**, **Limited** (default), or **Unrestricted**. In Limited mode, gated actions are blocked and logged via audit hooks while non-gated commands work normally. When CLI is Limited or Unrestricted, `wp cron` subcommands still respect the Cron policy — if Cron is Disabled, those commands are blocked even when CLI allows other operations.

## What about WPGraphQL?

When the [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) plugin is active, WP Sudo adds its own **WPGraphQL** policy setting with the same three modes: Disabled, Limited (default), and Unrestricted. WPGraphQL gating works at the surface level rather than per-action: in Limited mode, all mutations require an active sudo session while read-only queries always pass through. In Disabled mode, all requests to the endpoint are rejected. WP Sudo detects mutations by inspecting the request body for a `mutation` operation type. WPGraphQL handles its own URL routing, so gating works regardless of how the endpoint is configured.

## Why does WPGraphQL gating block all mutations rather than specific ones?

WP Sudo's action registry rules are tied to **WordPress action hooks** — `activate_plugin`, `delete_user`, `wp_update_options`, and so on. These hooks fire regardless of entry surface, which is how the same rules cover the admin UI, AJAX, and REST simultaneously.

WPGraphQL mutations do not reliably fire those same hooks. WPGraphQL dispatches through its own resolver chain, and whether a mutation eventually triggers a WordPress hook depends entirely on how each resolver is implemented. There is no guaranteed 1:1 mapping from "mutation name" to "WordPress action hook" across the full WPGraphQL ecosystem (core resolvers, WooCommerce, custom extensions).

Per-action gating would require either parsing GraphQL request bodies to extract operation names and maintaining a mutation→hook mapping, or a new WPGraphQL-specific rule type separate from the hook-based registry. Both carry significant ongoing maintenance cost for the plugins and custom mutations that WPGraphQL-based sites rely on.

The surface-level approach — blocking any request body containing `mutation` in Limited mode — is reliable and appropriate for the primary use case: headless deployments where mutations come from automated API clients rather than interactive admin users. For mutations that should not require a sudo session (content mutations, authentication handshakes, etc.), the `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass` filter provides precise per-mutation control without modifying the global policy.
FYI: In GraphQL, a "mutation" is a type of operation used to modify server-side data, causing side effects on the back end. While queries are used for fetching data, mutations are specifically designed for creating, updating, or deleting data. (This is similar to `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` in `REST`.) 

## Does WP Sudo work with WPGraphQL JWT Authentication?

The [wp-graphql-jwt-authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) plugin is the standard way to authenticate WPGraphQL requests using JSON Web Tokens. With WP Sudo's default **Limited** policy, two issues arise: (1) the JWT `login` mutation is sent by unauthenticated users who cannot have a sudo session, so it is blocked; (2) JWT-authenticated mutations fail because JWT requests do not carry the browser-bound sudo session cookie. The result is that Limited mode breaks the JWT authentication flow entirely.

**Solution:** Use the `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass` filter (added in v2.7.0) to exempt authentication mutations. Add this to an mu-plugin:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass', function ( bool $bypass, string $body ): bool {
    if ( $bypass ) {
        return $bypass;
    }
    if ( str_contains( $body, 'login' ) || str_contains( $body, 'refreshJwtAuthToken' ) ) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}, 10, 2 );
```

This exempts only the `login` and `refreshJwtAuthToken` mutations — all other mutations remain gated. Alternatively, set the policy to **Unrestricted** if you do not need mutation-level gating. See the [developer reference](docs/developer-reference.md#wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass-filter) for full details.

## What about the WordPress Abilities API?

The [Abilities API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities-api/) (introduced in WordPress 6.9) registers its own REST namespace at `/wp-abilities/v1/`. It uses standard WordPress REST authentication, so Application Password–authenticated requests are governed by WP Sudo's **REST API (App Passwords)** policy — no special configuration is needed. In Disabled mode, all Abilities API requests via Application Passwords are blocked. In Limited mode, ability reads and standard executions pass through as non-gated operations; site owners who want to require sudo for specific destructive ability executions can add custom rules via the `wp_sudo_gated_actions` filter.

## How does session binding work?

When sudo is activated, a cryptographic token is stored in a secure httponly cookie and its hash is saved in user meta. On every gated request, both must match. A stolen session cookie on a different browser will not have a valid sudo session. See [Security Model](security-model.md) for full details.

## How does 2FA browser binding work?

When the password step succeeds and 2FA is required, a one-time challenge cookie is set in the browser. The 2FA pending state is keyed by the hash of this cookie, not by user ID. An attacker who stole the WordPress session cookie but is on a different machine does not have the challenge cookie and cannot complete the 2FA step. See [Security Model](security-model.md) for full details.

## Is there brute-force protection?

Yes. After 5 failed password attempts on the reauthentication form, the user is locked out for 5 minutes. Lockout events fire the `wp_sudo_lockout` action hook for audit logging.

## How do I log sudo activity?

Install [WP Activity Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-audit-log/) or [Stream](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/). Sudo fires 9 action hooks covering session lifecycle, gated actions, policy decisions, lockouts, and tamper detection. See [Developer Reference](developer-reference.md) for hook signatures.

## Does it support two-factor authentication?

Yes. If the [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin is installed and the user has 2FA enabled, the sudo challenge becomes a two-step process: password first, then the configured 2FA method (TOTP, email code, backup codes, etc.). For passkey and security key support, add the [WebAuthn Provider for Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor-provider-webauthn/) plugin. A visible countdown timer shows how long the user has to enter their code. Third-party 2FA plugins can integrate via filter hooks — see [Developer Reference](developer-reference.md).

## Does it work on multisite?

Yes. Settings are network-wide (one configuration for all sites). Sudo sessions use user meta (shared across the network), so authenticating on one site covers all sites. The action registry includes network-specific rules for theme enable/disable, site management, super admin grant/revoke, and network settings. The settings page appears under **Network Admin > Settings > Sudo**. On uninstall, per-site data is cleaned per-site, and user meta is only removed when no remaining site has the plugin active.

## What is gated on multisite subsites?

On multisite, WordPress core already removes the most dangerous General Settings fields (site URL, home URL, membership, default role) from subsite admin pages — only Super Admins can change those at the network level. The remaining subsite settings (site title, tagline, admin email, timezone, date/time formats) are low-risk and not gated. Changing admin email also requires email confirmation by WordPress core. Network-level operations — network settings, theme management, site creation/deletion, and Super Admin grants — are all gated.

## What is the mu-plugin and do I need it?

The mu-plugin is optional. It ensures Sudo's gate hooks are registered before any other regular plugin loads, preventing another plugin from deregistering the hooks or processing dangerous actions before the gate fires. You can install it with one click from the settings page. The mu-plugin is a thin shim in `wp-content/mu-plugins/` that loads the gate code from the main plugin directory — it updates automatically with regular plugin updates.

## What happens if I deactivate the plugin?

Any active sudo sessions expire naturally. All gated actions return to their normal, ungated behavior. No data is lost. The mu-plugin shim (if installed) safely detects the missing main plugin and does nothing.

## Can I extend the list of gated actions?

Yes. Use the `wp_sudo_gated_actions` filter to add custom rules. See [Developer Reference](developer-reference.md) for the rule structure and code examples.

## Can I change the 2FA verification window?

Yes. The default window is 5 minutes. Use the `wp_sudo_two_factor_window` filter to adjust it (value in seconds). You cannot make it lower than 1 minute or higher than 15 minutes. A tiny window maximizes user inconvenience, and a large window minimizes the security benefits. 10-15 minutes is the industry norm, with 10m the usual default in *nix systems. See [Developer Reference](developer-reference.md).

## Does logging in automatically start a sudo session?

Yes (since v2.6.0). A successful browser-based WordPress login implicitly activates a sudo session. The user just proved their identity via the login form — requiring a second challenge immediately is unnecessary friction. This mirrors the behaviour of Unix `sudo` and GitHub's sudo mode.

Application Password and XML-RPC logins are **not** affected — the `wp_login` hook only fires for browser form logins, and these non-interactive paths don't produce a session cookie anyway.

## What happens when I change my password — does it affect my sudo session?

Password changes on `profile.php`, `user-edit.php`, or via the REST API (`PUT`/`PATCH /wp/v2/users/{id}`) are themselves a **gated action** (since v2.6.0), so they already require an active sudo session to proceed. Since v2.8.0, WP Sudo automatically expires the sudo session when a password change is saved.

## What is the grace period?

A 2-minute grace window (since v2.6.0) allows form submissions to complete even if the sudo session expired while the user was filling in the form. Without this, a user who spent three minutes on a form would have their work rejected and need to reauthenticate — and any unsaved input would be lost.

**How it works:** when the gate checks the session, it first calls `Sudo_Session::is_active()`. If the session has expired, it also calls `is_within_grace()`. If the expiry happened within the last 120 seconds *and* the session token still matches (session binding is enforced throughout), the request passes.

**What it does not relax:** session binding. A stolen cookie on a different browser does not gain grace-period access. The session token must still match — `is_within_grace()` calls `verify_token()` before returning true. The admin bar timer always reflects the true session state, not the grace state.

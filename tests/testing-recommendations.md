# Testing Recommendations

*Updated March 4, 2026*

**~~1. Measure before optimizing: add PCOV + coverage reporting~~ ✅ Done (v2.9.1, Codecov added v2.10.1)**

PCOV coverage CI job added (`unit-tests-coverage`, PHP 8.3 only). `composer test:coverage` generates Clover XML + text summary. Codecov integration uploads results and displays badge on the readme. Psalm type coverage published to Shepherd.dev.

**2. Cover the exit paths with `@runInSeparateProcess` — selectively**

The 76 `exit`/`die` paths are the biggest blind spot. You don't need to cover all 76 — most are `wp_send_json()` + `exit` in the Gate, and they follow the same pattern. Pick the 5–8 most security-critical exit paths (the ones that block destructive actions on REST, AJAX, and WPGraphQL surfaces) and write integration tests that run in separate processes. The rest follow the same code path and aren't worth the execution cost.

**~~3. Add a Challenge integration test~~ ✅ Done (v2.9.1)**

`tests/Integration/ChallengeTest.php` — 5 test methods covering: wrong password + audit hook, correct password + session activation, token binding (SHA-256 cookie ↔ user meta), request stash lifecycle, and rate-limiting lockout after max failed attempts.

**~~4. Test the uninstall cleanup~~ ✅ Done (v2.9.1)**

`tests/Integration/UninstallTest.php` — 2 test methods: single-site uninstall (options, user meta, capability restoration) and multisite uninstall (network-wide user meta cleanup when no site has the plugin active).

**5. Add mutation testing (long-term)**

Once coverage is measured and the critical gaps above are filled, mutation testing (Infection PHP) is the next level. It tells you not just "this line was executed" but "would the test fail if I changed this line?" A test suite can have 95% line coverage and still miss logic errors if assertions are weak. Mutation testing catches that. It's slow to run — probably nightly CI only — but it surfaces the tests that are executing code without actually verifying behavior.

**6. Coverage target: 80% floor, not 90%+ ceiling**

Unit test line coverage is 85.6% (2244/2621 lines). The remaining 14.4% is concentrated in:

- **Admin (70%)** — Settings API registration callbacks (`add_settings_section`, `add_settings_field`). Unit testing these means mocking the entire WordPress Settings API for tests that prove very little about security behavior.
- **Challenge (81%)** — Interstitial page rendering, form handling, 2FA provider integration. These are full HTTP flows tested by integration tests (ChallengeTest), not unit tests.
- **Gate (87%)** — The remaining uncovered lines are REST/AJAX/CLI policy branches, also integration test territory.

Pushing unit coverage from 85% to 90% would require ~20+ new unit tests heavily mocking WordPress internals. These tests break on WP updates without catching real bugs — high maintenance, low signal.

**Set Codecov threshold at 80%** to prevent regressions. The actual effective coverage (unit + integration) is higher than what Codecov reports, since integration tests (130 tests) cover many of the same paths but aren't included in the Codecov upload.

Better investments for test quality:
- More integration tests (real WP, real DB, real flows)
- Exit path tests for security-critical surfaces
- Multisite-specific integration coverage

**7. What I would NOT do**

- Don't add coverage gates to every CI matrix entry — one PHP version is enough
- Don't write tests for Admin_Bar or Site_Health integration — they're UI readouts with no security implications, unit tests are sufficient
- Don't pursue 100% line coverage as a goal — the last 15% is always the most expensive and least valuable
- Don't add `@runInSeparateProcess` to unit tests — it's an integration test tool for testing real exit behavior
- Don't chase unit test coverage for code better served by integration tests — Admin rendering, Challenge page flows, and Gate policy branches are all in this category

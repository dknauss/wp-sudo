LLM Lies Log
=============
Fabricated, outdated, and unverified claims generated by Claude and
committed to repositories without verification against live sources.

Audited: 2026-02-19
Repos:   wp-sudo, wordpress-2fa-ecosystem


1. FABRICATED METHOD NAME — AIOS / Simba TFA
   Files:  ecosystem-survey.md, bridge-guide.md, aios-bridge.php,
           two-factor-ecosystem.md (wp-sudo copy)
   Claim:  authUserFromLogin()
   Reality: authorise_user_from_login()
   Source:  WordPress.org SVN trunk, simba-tfa.php
   Notes:  Method name was invented wholesale. Not a typo or
           versioning issue — the method never existed under this name.

2. FABRICATED META KEY — AIOS tfa_algorithm_type
   Files:  ecosystem-survey.md
   Claim:  tfa_algorithm_type user meta stores 'totp' or 'hotp'
   Reality: Does not exist. Actual user meta keys are tfa_enable_tfa,
           tfa_priv_key_64, and tfa_trusted_devices.
   Source:  WordPress.org SVN trunk, simba-tfa.php grep of all meta keys
   Notes:  Entirely fabricated. No such meta key in any version of the
           Simba TFA engine.

3. FABRICATED CLASS NAME — AIOS Simba_Two_Factor_Authentication
   Files:  aios-bridge.php (class_exists check)
   Claim:  class_exists( 'Simba_Two_Factor_Authentication' )
   Reality: Actual class is Simba_Two_Factor_Authentication_1
           (subclassed by AIO_WP_Security_Simba_Two_Factor_Authentication_Plugin)
   Source:  WordPress.org SVN trunk, wp-security-two-factor-login.php

4. FABRICATED/OUTDATED META KEY — miniOrange mo2f_selected_2factor_method
   Files:  ecosystem-survey.md, two-factor-ecosystem.md (wp-sudo copy)
   Claim:  get_user_meta( $user_id, 'mo2f_selected_2factor_method', true )
   Reality: Current trunk uses 'currentMethod' as the user meta key.
           'mo2f_configured_2FA_method' exists but is nested inside
           array-valued meta entries, not a standalone key.
   Source:  WordPress.org SVN trunk, class-mo2fdb.php
   Notes:  May have existed in an older version, or may be fully
           fabricated. Either way, not verified before publishing.

5. STALE TRAINING DATA — Plugin install counts (all 7 plugins)
   Files:  README.md, ecosystem-survey.md
   Claim:  Two Factor 50,000+, WP 2FA 60,000+, Solid Security 800,000+,
           Shield 50,000+, miniOrange 20,000+
   Reality: Two Factor 100,000+, WP 2FA 90,000+, Solid Security 700,000+,
           Shield 40,000+, miniOrange 10,000+
   Source:  WordPress.org Plugin Info API (live query)
   Notes:  All numbers pulled from training data instead of querying the
           API, which takes one curl command. The repo was created on
           2026-02-16 — these numbers were wrong from day one, not due to
           drift over time. The Two Factor count was off by 100%.


6. STALE COUNT — Help tab count
   Files:  readme.md, readme.txt, docs/ui-ux-testing-prompts.md
   Claim:  "10 help tabs on the settings page" — wait, the claim was "8"
   Reality: 10 help tabs exist: How Sudo Works, Session & Policies,
           App Passwords, MU-Plugin, Security Features, Security Model,
           Environment, Recommended Plugins, Extending, Audit Hooks.
   Source:  grep 'add_help_tab' includes/class-admin.php (10 results)
   Notes:  Count was set to 8 when there were 8 tabs. Three new tabs
           were added across v2.3.x–v2.4.x (App Passwords, MU-Plugin,
           Session & Policies replacing "Settings") but the count in
           readme files was never updated. The tab name lists in
           ui-ux-testing-prompts.md also drifted: "Settings" was listed
           as a tab name when no such tab exists.

7. STALE COUNT — Gated rules count
   Files:  tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md (section 9.4)
   Claim:  "A table listing all 28 gated rules"
   Reality: 29 rules. user.change_password was added in v2.6.0 (2026-02).
   Source:  grep in includes/class-action-registry.php, readme.txt (29+)
   Notes:  The MANUAL-TESTING.md was not updated when user.change_password
           was added to the action registry in v2.6.0.


8. CONFABULATED DOCUMENTATION — wp_sudo_action_allowed in ai-agentic-guidance.md
   Files:  docs/ai-agentic-guidance.md
   Claim:  "For Unrestricted surfaces, the wp_sudo_action_allowed hook fires"
           with full do_action() code example showing the hook signature.
   Reality: The hook was never wired up. No do_action() call existed in the
           codebase. The hook was a leftover from the original two-tier
           (Block/Allow) model and was marked as "legacy; not fired by
           current three-tier model" in the Site Health help tab.
   Source:  grep -r 'wp_sudo_action_allowed' includes/ (zero matches
           at the time of discovery)
   Notes:  The documentation was fabricated — it described behavior that
           did not exist and presented it as fact with a code example.
           Discovered during CLAUDE.md audit, 2026-02-27. The hook has
           since been revived and now genuinely fires on Unrestricted
           surfaces for all gated actions.


ROOT CAUSE
----------
All errors stem from the same pattern: generating reference content from
training data instead of verifying against live, authoritative sources.
The WordPress.org Plugin Info API, WordPress.org SVN, and GitHub raw
file URLs were all available and could have been queried in seconds.

The fabricated method and meta key names are the worst category — these
are not stale facts but invented strings that sound plausible. A human
reading the documentation would have no reason to doubt them, and code
using them would fail silently or throw errors.

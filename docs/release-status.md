# Release Status (Canonical Current State)

Last verified: 2026-04-19

This file is the canonical source for **current release state** in this repository:

- the latest public/stable WP Sudo version
- unreleased work already present on `main`
- the latest stable WordPress release WP Sudo should advertise in public metadata
- the forward WordPress lane used in CI, Playground, and manual verification
- the current status of the delayed WordPress 7.0 final release

## Stable plugin release

- **Stable tag:** `2.14.0`
- **Runtime version constant:** `2.14.0`
- **Public metadata should match:** `readme.txt` stable tag, `wp-sudo.php`, `tests/bootstrap.php`, `phpstan-bootstrap.php`

## Unreleased work already on `main`

These items are implemented on `main` but not yet part of a tagged public release:

- Lockdown policy presets
- Connectors API credential-write gating
- Challenge/lockout recovery hardening
- Request / Rule Tester diagnostic tool
- Event_Store persistence layer with cron-based pruning
- Session Activity Dashboard Widget (Active Sessions, Recent Events, Policy Summary)
- Accessibility improvements (table scope/caption attributes)
- Additional local/CI/browser testing workflow improvements

Canonical source for this list: `CHANGELOG.md` → `## Unreleased`

## WordPress release posture

### Latest stable WordPress release

- **Latest stable major/minor branch:** `6.9`
- **Latest stable patch release observed:** `6.9.4`

### Forward lane used by this repository

- **Forward WordPress lane in CI/local previews:** `7.0-RC1`
- This is a forward-compatibility target for testing and preview workflows, **not** the current public `Tested up to` value.

### WordPress 7.0 final release status

- The previously scheduled **April 9, 2026** WordPress 7.0 final release was delayed on **March 31, 2026**.
- As of **April 17, 2026**, no replacement final release date is published.
- The Make/Core 7.0 release page says an updated final-stretch schedule will be published **no later than April 22, 2026**.

## Public metadata rule

Until WordPress 7.0 final actually ships:

- keep `readme.txt` **Tested up to** at `6.9`
- keep README support badges aligned with the latest stable release line
- record forward 7.0 readiness in `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md`, and this file instead of claiming a final 7.0 public support bump early

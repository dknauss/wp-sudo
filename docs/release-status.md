## WordPress release posture

### Latest stable WordPress release

- **Latest stable major/minor branch:** `6.9`
- **Latest stable patch release observed:** `6.9.4` (released March 11, 2026; verified as latest stable on May 11, 2026)

### Forward lane used by this repository

- **Forward WordPress lane in CI/local previews:** `7.0-RC1`
- This is a forward-compatibility target for testing and preview workflows, **not** the current public `Tested up to` value.

### WordPress 7.0 final release status

- The previously scheduled **April 9, 2026** WordPress 7.0 final release was delayed on **March 31, 2026**.
- The updated Make/Core schedule published on **April 22, 2026** sets the new WordPress 7.0 final release date at **May 20, 2026**.
- Current final-stretch checkpoints are **RC3 on May 8, 2026**, **RC4 on May 14, 2026**, **dry run/code freeze on May 19, 2026**, and **general release on May 20, 2026**.
- As of **May 11, 2026**, WordPress 7.0 is still unreleased; the latest stable public release remains **6.9.4**.

## Public metadata rule

Until WordPress 7.0 final actually ships:

- keep `readme.txt` **Tested up to** at `6.9`
- keep README support badges aligned with the latest stable release line
- record forward 7.0 readiness in `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md`, and this file instead of claiming a final 7.0 public support bump early

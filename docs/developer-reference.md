# Developer Reference

## Gated Action Rule Structure

Use the `wp_sudo_gated_actions` filter to add custom rules. Each rule defines matching criteria for admin UI (`pagenow`, actions, HTTP method), AJAX (action names), and REST (route patterns, HTTP methods). Custom rules appear in the Gated Actions table on the settings page.

All rules — including custom rules — are automatically protected on non-interactive surfaces (WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, Application Passwords) via the configurable policy settings, even if they don't define AJAX or REST criteria. WPGraphQL is gated by its own surface-level policy rather than per-rule matching — in Limited mode, all mutations require a sudo session regardless of which action they perform. See [WPGraphQL Surface](#wpgraphql-surface) below.

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sudo_gated_actions', function ( array $rules ): array {
    $rules[] = array(
        'id'       => 'custom.my_action',
        'label'    => 'My dangerous action',
        'category' => 'custom',
        'admin'    => array(
            'pagenow'  => 'admin.php',
            'actions'  => array( 'my_dangerous_action' ),
            'method'   => 'POST',
            'callback' => function (): bool {
                return some_extra_condition();
            },
        ),
        'ajax'     => array(
            'actions' => array( 'my_ajax_action' ),
        ),
        'rest'     => array(
            'route'   => '#^/my-namespace/v1/dangerous#',
            'methods' => array( 'POST', 'DELETE' ),
        ),
    );
    return $rules;
} );
```

## Audit Hook Signatures

Sudo fires 9 action hooks for external logging integration with [WP Activity Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-audit-log/), [Stream](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/), and similar plugins.

```php
// Session lifecycle.
do_action( 'wp_sudo_activated', int $user_id, int $expires, int $duration );
do_action( 'wp_sudo_deactivated', int $user_id );

// Authentication failures.
do_action( 'wp_sudo_reauth_failed', int $user_id, int $attempts );
do_action( 'wp_sudo_lockout', int $user_id, int $attempts );

// Action gating.
// $surface values: 'admin', 'ajax', 'rest_app_password', 'cli', 'cron', 'xmlrpc', 'wpgraphql'
do_action( 'wp_sudo_action_gated', int $user_id, string $rule_id, string $surface );
do_action( 'wp_sudo_action_blocked', int $user_id, string $rule_id, string $surface );
do_action( 'wp_sudo_action_allowed', int $user_id, string $rule_id, string $surface );
do_action( 'wp_sudo_action_replayed', int $user_id, string $rule_id );

// Tamper detection.
do_action( 'wp_sudo_capability_tampered', string $role, string $capability );
```

## Filters

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| `wp_sudo_gated_actions` | Add or modify gated action rules. |
| `wp_sudo_two_factor_window` | 2FA verification window in seconds (default: 300). |
| `wp_sudo_requires_two_factor` | Whether a user needs 2FA for sudo (for third-party 2FA plugins). |
| `wp_sudo_validate_two_factor` | Validate a 2FA code (for third-party 2FA plugins). |
| `wp_sudo_render_two_factor_fields` | Render 2FA input fields (for third-party 2FA plugins). |

## Testing

Two test environments are used deliberately — choose based on what you are testing:

**Unit tests** (`tests/Unit/`) use Brain\Monkey to mock all WordPress functions. Fast (~0.3s total). Run with `composer test:unit`. Use for: request matching logic, session state machine, policy enforcement, hook registration, settings sanitization.

**Integration tests** (`tests/Integration/`) load real WordPress against a MySQL database via `WP_UnitTestCase`. Run with `composer test:integration` (requires one-time setup — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)). Use for: full reauth flows, real bcrypt verification, transient TTL and cookie behavior, REST and AJAX gating, Two Factor interaction, multisite session isolation, upgrader migrations.

When in doubt: if the test needs a real database, real crypto, or calls that cross class boundaries in production, write an integration test.

Static analysis: `composer analyse` runs PHPStan level 6 (use `--memory-limit=1G` if needed). Zero errors required.

Code style: `composer lint` (PHPCS, WordPress-Extra + WordPress-Docs + WordPressVIPMinimum rulesets). Auto-fix with `composer lint:fix`.

Manual testing: see [`tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md`](../tests/MANUAL-TESTING.md) for step-by-step verification procedures against a real WordPress environment.

## Session API

### `Sudo_Session::is_active( int $user_id ): bool`

Returns `true` if the user has an unexpired sudo session with a valid token. This is the primary check used throughout the plugin. Returns `false` and defers meta cleanup if the session has expired within the grace window (see `is_within_grace()`).

### `Sudo_Session::is_within_grace( int $user_id ): bool`

Returns `true` when the session has expired **within the last `GRACE_SECONDS` (120 s)** and the session token still matches the cookie. Used by the Gate at interactive decision points (admin UI, REST, WPGraphQL) to allow in-flight form submissions to complete after the session timer expires.

Session binding is enforced during the grace window — `verify_token()` is called before returning `true`. A stolen cookie on a different browser does not gain grace access.

The admin bar UI uses `is_active()` only; it always reflects the true session state.

### `Sudo_Session::activate( int $user_id ): void`

Creates a new sudo session: generates a token, writes user meta, sets the httponly cookie, and fires `wp_sudo_activated`. Also called automatically by `Plugin::grant_session_on_login()` on successful browser-based login (`wp_login` hook).

### `Sudo_Session::GRACE_SECONDS`

Class constant (`int 120`). The length of the grace window in seconds. Can be referenced in custom code that inspects session state.

## WPGraphQL Surface

WP Sudo adds WPGraphQL as a fifth non-interactive surface alongside WP-CLI, Cron, XML-RPC, and Application Passwords. The policy setting key is `wpgraphql_policy` (stored in `wp_sudo_settings`). The three-tier model applies: Disabled, Limited (default), Unrestricted.

**How gating works.** WPGraphQL does not use the WordPress REST API pipeline — it dispatches requests via rewrite rules at `parse_request`. WP Sudo hooks into WPGraphQL's own `graphql_process_http_request` action, which fires after authentication but before body reading, regardless of how the endpoint is named or configured. In Limited mode, requests whose POST body contains the string `mutation` are blocked unless the requesting user has an active sudo session.

**Why surface-level rather than per-action.** The action registry rules are keyed to WordPress action hooks — `activate_plugin`, `delete_user`, `wp_update_options`, etc. — that fire regardless of entry surface. WPGraphQL mutations do not reliably fire those same hooks; they dispatch through WPGraphQL's own resolver chain, and the mapping from mutation name to WordPress hook depends entirely on how each resolver is implemented. Per-action gating would therefore require either (a) parsing the GraphQL request body to extract operation names and maintaining a mutation→hook mapping across the full WPGraphQL ecosystem, or (b) a new WPGraphQL-specific rule type separate from the hook-based registry. Both approaches carry significant ongoing maintenance cost. The surface-level heuristic — block any body containing `mutation` — is reliable for the primary use case (headless deployments where mutations come from automated clients, not interactive users) and the `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass` filter provides the escape hatch for mutations that should not require a sudo session (see below).

**Headless deployments.** The Limited policy requires both a recognized WordPress user and an active sudo session cookie. For frontends running at a different origin, this means mutations will be blocked in most configurations — the sudo session cookie is browser-bound and can only be created via the WordPress admin UI. See [WPGraphQL: Headless Authentication Boundary](security-model.md#wpgraphql-headless-authentication-boundary) in the security model for full details and per-deployment policy recommendations.

**Persisted queries.** The `str_contains($body, 'mutation')` heuristic does not detect mutations sent via WPGraphQL's Persisted Queries extension. Use the Disabled policy if mutation blocking is a hard security requirement in a persisted-query environment.

### `wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass` filter

Fires in Limited mode before mutation detection. Return `true` to allow the request through without sudo session checks. Does **not** fire in Disabled or Unrestricted mode — those policies return before this point.

```php
/**
 * @param bool   $bypass Whether to bypass gating. Default false.
 * @param string $body   The raw GraphQL request body.
 * @return bool
 */
apply_filters( 'wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass', false, $body );
```

**JWT authentication example.** The [wp-graphql-jwt-authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) plugin adds `login` and `refreshJwtAuthToken` mutations. These must bypass WP Sudo because they *are* the authentication mechanism — the `login` mutation is sent by unauthenticated users who cannot have a sudo session. Add this to an mu-plugin or theme:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sudo_wpgraphql_bypass', function ( bool $bypass, string $body ): bool {
    if ( $bypass ) {
        return $bypass;
    }
    // Exempt JWT authentication mutations only.
    if ( str_contains( $body, 'login' ) || str_contains( $body, 'refreshJwtAuthToken' ) ) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}, 10, 2 );
```

This uses the same `str_contains()` heuristic as the mutation detection. For more precise matching, use `preg_match()` to extract the mutation operation name from the body.
